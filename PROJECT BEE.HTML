    <h1>About Honey Bees</h1>
<p>A honey bee (also spelled honeybee) is a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade, all native to mainland Afro-Eurasia. After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and Eurasia, humans became responsible for the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees, introducing multiple subspecies into South America (early 16th century), North America (early 17th century), and Australia (early 19th century).</p>
<h2>5 facts on Honey Bees </h2>
<p>1)<b>Honey bees have five eyes:</b>Two large compound eyes and three smaller ocelli on their head. <br>
2) <b>They communicate through a dance:</b>Honey bees use the "waggle dance" to communicate the location and direction of food sources. <br>
3) <b>They are excellent flyers: </b>Honey bees can fly at speeds of up to 20 mph. <br>
4)<b>Only female bees can sting:</b>Male bees, called drones, do not have stingers. <br>
5) <b>Honey bees are incredibly clean: </b>They maintain a clean hive environment. </p>
<h2>Types of Honey Bees </h2>
There are many types of Honey Bees.The some of the comman bees are-
1)The Rock Bee (Apis dorsata) <br>
2)The Indian Hive Bee (Apis cerana indica)<br>
3)The Little Bee (Apis florea)<br>
4)The European or Western Bee (Apis mellifera)<br>
5) The Dammer or Stingless Bee (Melipona irridipennis)
<h2>Where do Honey Bees live?</h2>
Honeybees live in colonies called beehives. These hives can be natural, like tree cavities or under edges of objects, or domesticated, like those kept by beekeepers. Bees typically prefer areas with abundant flowering plants like gardens, woodlands, orchards, and meadows. 
<h2>Categories of bees living in a hive</h2>
The categories of bees living in a hive are- <br>
1)Queen Bee <br>
2)Worker bee  <br>
3)Drone bee
<h2>The lifespan of Honey Bees</h2>
1)<b>Queen Bees:</b> 
Queen bees can live for an average of 2-3 years, but can sometimes live up to 5 years or even longer. They are the only fertile female bees in the hive and are responsible for laying eggs.<br>
2)<b>Worker Bees:</b>
Worker bees have a shorter lifespan. In summer, they typically live for 4-6 weeks, while those born in the fall can live for several months, sometimes up to 150-200 days, as they help the colony survive the winter. <br>
3)<b>Drone Bees:</b>
Drone bees are male honey bees, and their primary purpose is to mate with the queen. They typically die soon after mating, although some records exist of drones living up to 90 days. 
<h2>The roles of Honey bees</h2>
<h4>1)<b> Queen Bees:</b></h4> <br>
<b>Egg laying:</b>The queen bee's primary function is to lay eggs, ensuring the continuation of the colony. <br>
 <b>Producing pheromones:</b>
She releases pheromones that help maintain colony cohesion and prevent other worker bees from laying eggs. <br>
<h4>2)<b>Worker Bees:</b></h4><br>
<b>Cleaning and maintaining the hive:</b>Worker bees clean the hive, remove debris, and ventilate the hive, maintaining a clean and healthy environment. <br>
 <b>Caring for the brood (larvae and pupae):</b>They feed larvae, clean their cells, and protect them from threats. <br>
<b>Building and repairing the honeycomb: </b>Worker bees secrete beeswax and use it to build and repair the honeycomb, creating the structure of the hive. <br>
<b>Collecting nectar and pollen: </b>They forage for nectar and pollen, which are used to produce honey and pollen, respectively. <br>
 <b>Guarding the hive:</b>Some worker bees act as guards, defending the hive entrance from intruders. <br> 
 <b>Regulating temperature:</b>Worker bees, especially younger ones, help regulate hive temperature through fanning, which involves beating their wings to create airflow. <br>
 <b>Making honey:</b>Worker bees collect nectar and process it into honey, storing it in the honeycomb. <br>
<h4>3)<b>Drone Bees:</b> </h4>
<b>Mating with the queen:</b>Drones are male bees whose sole purpose is to mate with the queen.
