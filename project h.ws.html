    <H1>Famous Monuments of the World</H1>
  <h2>  What are Monuments?</h2>
  Monuments are structures, often buildings or statues, built to commemorate a person, event, or idea. They are also used to honor historical figures or events and can serve as a reminder of the past. Monuments can be large and elaborate, or small and simple, depending on their purpose and historical significance. 
<h2>What do you mean by the Seven Wonders of the World?</h2>
The "Seven Wonders of the World" refers to lists of historically significant and architecturally impressive structures, both ancient and modern. There are two main lists: the "Seven Wonders of the Ancient World" and the "New Seven Wonders of the World". The ancient wonders were compiled by ancient Greeks, while the New Seven Wonders were selected in a global vote in 2007.

    <H1>About Honeybees </H1>
    <p>A honeybee (also spelled honey bee) is a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade, all native to mainland Afro-Eurasia. After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and Eurasia, humans became responsible for the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees, introducing multiple subspecies into South America (early 16th century), North America (early 17th century), and Australia (early 19th century).</p>
<h2>5 facts on Honeybees</h2>
<p> 1) <b> They have five eyes:</b> Two large compound eyes and three smaller ocelli on their head. </p>
<p> 2) <b>They communicate through a dance:</b> Honey bees use the "waggle dance" to communicate the location and direction of food sources.  </p>
<p> 3) <b>They are excellent flyers:</b>  Honey bees can fly at speeds of up to 20 mph. 
<p>4) <b>Only female bees can sting:</b> Male bees, called drones, do not have stingers. </p>
<p>5) <b>Honey bees are incredibly clean:</b> They maintain a clean hive environment. </p>
<h2>Lifespan of Honeybees</h2>
<p><b>Queen Bees:</b>
Queen bees can live for an average of 2-3 years, but can sometimes live up to 5 years or even longer. They are the only fertile female bees in the hive and are responsible for laying eggs. <br>
<b>Worker Bees:</b>
Worker bees have a shorter lifespan. In summer, they typically live for 4-6 weeks, while those born in the fall can live for several months, sometimes up to 150-200 days, as they help the colony survive the winter. <br>
<b>Drone Bees:</b>
Drone bees are male honey bees, and their primary purpose is to mate with the queen. They typically die soon after mating, although some records exist of drones living up to 90 days</p><br>
<h2>Role of different Bees</h2>
<p><b>Worker Bee Roles:</b><br>
<b>Foraging:</b> Collecting nectar, pollen, water, and propolis from flowers and other <br>
<b>Hive Construction:</b> Building and maintaining the honeycomb using beeswax.<br>
<b>Brood Care: </b> Feeding larvae, cleaning cells, and caring for developing bees.<br>
<b>Hive Maintenance:</b> Cleaning the hive, ventilating it (fanning), and regulating <br>
<b>Defense:</b> Guarding the hive entrance and protecting the colony.<br>
<b>Honey Production:</b>Processing nectar into honey and storing it in <br>
<b>Queen Attendants:</b> Providing care for the queen, including grooming, feeding, and attending to her needs. </p>
<p><b>Queen Bee Roles:</b><br>
<b>Egg-laying:</b> Laying eggs in the honeycomb to create new bees. </p>
<p><b>Drone Bee Roles:</b>
<b>Mating:</b> Attempting to mate with the queen to ensure the continued survival and reproduction of the colony. </p>
